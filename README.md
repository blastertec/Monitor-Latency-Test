# Comparison of latency for 240 and 60 hz monitors

tldr: 240Hz monitor provides faster response time, which gives you huge advantage in FPS shooters (not even taking into account overall smoothness of the picture/game process).


Though when switched to non-native 60Hz refresh rate Acer demonstrated even higher latency than an old 60Hz Dell.
